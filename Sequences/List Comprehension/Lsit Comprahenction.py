# Poem ="""Whose woods these are I think I know.   
# His house is in the village though;   
# He will not see me stopping here   
# To watch his woods fill up with snow.   
# My little horse must think it queer   
# To stop without a farmhouse near   
# Between the woods and frozen lake   
# The darkest evening of the year.   
# He gives his harness bells a shake   
# To ask if there is some mistake.   
# The only other soundâ€™s the sweep   
# Of easy wind and downy flake.   
# The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
# But I have promises to keep,   
# And miles to go before I sleep,   
# And miles to go before I sleep  Finnally."""
